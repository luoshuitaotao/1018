### What is Data Science?
Data Science is the art and science of transforming raw data into deliverable data products in order to help businesses or government agencies make more informed decisions. The Concentration in Data Science consists of eight major components: Data Visualization, Scientific Methods, Statistical Modeling, Statistical Computing, Real-world Data Applications, Data Consulting, Data Research, and Data Technology.

The Concentration in Data Science prepares students for a job as a Data Scientist, as well as providing a strong background for many other careers.

Because Data Science is a rapidly expanding field, creating a high demand for Data Scientists, the Department of Mathematics is committed to developing partnerships with the local business community, not only to assist with their data analysis needs, but to demonstrate the value of our Math majors.

These eight components capture the essence of integrating our data science educational program with the data demands of the business community on a multitude of levels.

The following is a brief description of each component and its relevance and importance to our program.

1. Data Visualization

Transforming raw data into a visual form that tells a “story” is one of the major challenges in the business world. The center piece of our program is the art and science of data visualization with real-world applications.

2. Scientific Methods

Scientific methods are used to analyze and reduce complex data to simpler forms.

3. Statistical Modeling

Many business problems can be modeled using sophisticated advanced statistical methods. We have several faculty with strong backgrounds in statistics, both pure and applied.

4. Statistical Computing

Students and faculty alike use powerful statistical software to perform the tedious computations required in data analysis.

5. Real-world data applications

Our students work on real-world data problems provided to us by local industry.

6. Data Consulting

Our department will provide consulting on data-related problems to the local community. This has the potential of laying the foundation for major data science projects for our students, as well as providing valuable real-world experience

7. Data Research

The department has several researchers in statistics and operations research. We plan to develop research problems in data science in collaboration with the local community. This will strengthen the academic research program and lay the foundation for a possible future doctorate in Data Science.

8. Data Technology

The department has access to big data technology, as well as sophisticated data science software. We plan to expand the technology with a Data Science Lab housed in our department and supported by the local business community.
