Data Science is the art and science of transforming raw data into deliverable data products in order to help businesses or government agencies make more informed decisions. The Concentration in Data Science consists of eight major components: Data Visualization, Scientific Methods, Statistical Modeling, Statistical Computing, Real-world Data Applications, Data Consulting, Data Research, and Data Technology.

The Concentration in Data Science prepares students for a job as a Data Scientist, as well as providing a strong background for many other careers.

Because Data Science is a rapidly expanding field, creating a high demand for Data Scientists, the Department of Mathematics is committed to developing partnerships with the local business community, not only to assist with their data analysis needs, but to demonstrate the value of our Math majors.
